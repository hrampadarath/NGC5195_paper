\begin{abstract}
We present a study of the nearby galaxy, NGC~5195, located in the M51 system at centimetre wavelengths. Using 
multi-wavelength archive data from the {Very Large Array (VLA)}, we report on the discovery of an ejecta or jet that extends 15\arcs ($\approx$ 0.6 kpc) from the central {active galactic nucleus (AGN)} and an arc of radio emission 20\arcs - 40\arcs ($\approx$ 0.8 - 1.6 kpc)  South of the nucleus.  Observations with the e-MERLIN (e-Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network) reveal within the VLA radio core, a partially resolved source with faint extended emission, possibly outflows from the AGN. The radio-jet and radio-arc are coincident with a pair of previously discovered X-rays and H$\alpha$ arcs. The spectral indices of the core and radio-jet are typical for non-thermal emission, favouring shock-generation. Using standard models of optical line emission from shock-ionized gas, we show that based upon energetics, the radio-jet has sufficient power to create the H$\alpha$ arcs. Comparing the VLA 5~GHz core luminosity and the power-law component from the \textit{Chandra} X-ray emission, and an estimate of the black hole mass (from the M - $\sigma$ relation) we show that the nucleus of NGC~5195 falls within the estimates of the black hole fundamental plane and is accreting at $\sim 10^{-6}$ Eddington. Thus we suggest that the X-ray and radio emission are both coming from the same source, the radio-jet. The radio loudness parameter, and Eddington ratio places NGC 5195 in the region between radio-quiet and radio-loud AGNs. These results suggest that the surrounding medium is being inflated by mechanical energy in the form of an ejecta giving rise to the X-ray and H$\alpha$ arcs. NGC~5195 is a clear demonstration of the feedback process in a nearby irregular galaxy, within an interacting galaxy system.

\section{Introduction}

%Start with descibing X-ray bubbles/arcs in radio galaxies, cluster and ULX's
%use footnote to distinguish from cavities. 

The grand spiral galaxy, NGC~5194 (M51a) along with its smaller companion, NGC~5195 (M51b), an
early-type galaxy, form the Messier~51 (M51) interacting system. The peculiar appearance of NGC~5195 has led it to be variously classified as SB0$_{1}$-pec 
\citep{SandageTammann1981} and I0-pec \citep{RC3}. While optical spectroscopy, suggests NGC~5195 core is 
a LINER \citep{hoetal1997}, a signature of a low-luminosity AGN.  
 
Analysis of \textit{Chandra} X-ray observations of NGC~5195, by \cite{SJMV} (hereafter 
SJMV) revealed an X-ray emitting region with a double arc-like structure. The arcs located on the 
south side, $\sim15^{\prime \prime} - 30^{\prime \prime} $ of the nucleus, may be 
similar to the bubbles observed in clusters and ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs).  

In addition, SJMV found evidence for an  H$\alpha$ 
arc located just outside of the outer X-ray arc. In their study, SJMV presented evidence that out-going 
shocks are clearing gas along the travelling axis, which is observed as two X-ray arcs representing 
episodes of outflows.  SJMV suggests that the arcs are 
the result of episodic outflows that are driven by mechanical feedback from the central super-massive black hole (SMBH). 
Which, as suggested by SJMV, may have resulted from infalling matter from a recent interaction of NGC~5195 
and its larger companion NGC~5194  (50-500 Myr ago, \cite{SL2000,Dobbsetal2010,Mentuchetal2012}). 


If indeed, the episodic X-ray bubbles in NGC~5195 are caused by mechanical feedback from the SMBH, then it may have created radio jets/outflows. 

The jets/outflows would then be responsible for inflating the surrounding medium into the observed X-ray and H$\alpha$ arcs/bubbles. 

\textbf{Non-thermal radio emission have been detected in NGC~5195 at 151~MHz with LOFAR (Low-Frequency Array) \citep{Mulcahyetal2014} and 325~MHz with the GMRT (Giant Metre-wave Radio Telescope) \citep{Mulcahyetal2016}.
\cite{Mulcahyetal2014} computed spectral indices between 151~MHZ and 1.4 GHz of $\sim$0.65 for the core and $\sim$0.75 for the outer-arc. }
 
In this paper, we present new observations of NGC~5195 taken with the e-MERLIN array (enhanced Multi-
Element Remote-Linked Interferometer Network) at 18~cm and 6~cm as part of the LeMMINGS project (Legacy 
e-MERLIN Multi-Band Imaging of Nearby Galaxies Survey; \citealt{lemmings2014}) that, together with 
archived multi-frequency continuum VLA (Very Large Array) observations, indicate 
the surrounding medium is being inflated by an outflow/ejecta from the AGN within NGC~5195, giving rise to the X-ray and H$\alpha$ arcs/bubbles.

Throughout this paper, we define the spectral index, $\alpha$ as, $S_{\nu} \propto \nu^{\alpha}$, where $S_{\nu}$ is the measured flux density at frequency, $\nu$. We also adopt a distance to NGC~5194 and NGC~5195 of  8.0 Mpc (1\arcs $\approx$ 40~parsecs) \citep{SJMV}.


\section{Data and Results}
\label{sec:obs}

\subsection{e-MERLIN}

NGC~5195 (RA = 13$^{\mathrm{h}}$29$^{\mathrm{m}}$ 59.537$^{\mathrm{s}}$; Dec = +47$^{\circ}$15$^{\prime}$ 58$^{\prime\prime}$.38 [J2000.0]) was observed with the e-MERLIN array as part of the LeMMINGS survey at both L and C bands\footnote{We define the following bands: L-band covers 1 - 2 GHz; C-band covers 4 - 8 GHz; X-band covers 8 - 12 GHz)}. The observations are summarised in \Tab~\ref{tab:eMerObs}. 

The e-MERLIN L-band observation was phase referenced to J1335+4542 (RA = 13$^{\mathrm{h}}$ 35$^{\mathrm{m}}$ 
21.9623$^{\mathrm{s}}$; Dec = +45$^{\circ}$ 42$^{\prime}$ 38$^{\prime\prime}$.231 [J2000.0]), located 1.81\deg from NGC~5195.
The e-MERLIN C-band observation was phase-referenced to the nearby calibration source J1332+4722 (RA = 13$^{\mathrm{h}}$ 32$^{\mathrm{m}}$ 45.246$^{\mathrm{s}}$; Dec = +47$^{\circ}$ 22$^{\prime}$ 22$^{\prime\prime}$.667 [J2000.0]) located 0.48\deg from NGC~5195. All observations employed a phase-referencing cycle of 7 minutes on target and 1 minute on calibrator. {We observed the standard flux	calibrator 3C286 to	calibrate the amplitude scale to an accuracy of 5$\%$ and calibrated the bandpass using OQ208. }

The e-MERLIN datasets were averaged to 128 channels {per} intermediate frequency (IF; four at C-band, eight at L-band). Following extensive flagging of bad data due to radio frequency interference, the datasets were calibrated in 
\textsc{aips}\footnote{The Astronomical Imaging Processing System is owned and maintained by the National Radio  
Astronomical  Observatory  (NRAO)} using the e-MERLIN calibration pipeline\footnote{\url{http://www.e-
merlin.ac.uk/observe/pipeline/}} \citep{Argo2014}, with the procedure described in the e-MERLIN 
Cookbook\footnote{\url{http://www.e-merlin.ac.uk/data_red/tools/e-merlin-cookbook_V3.0_Feb2015.pdf}}. 

To make full use of the {wide-bandwidth e-MERLIN data}, the calibrated datasets were imaged using the 
multi-scale, multi-frequency synthesis \citep{RC2011} algorithm in the Common Astronomical Software 
Applications (\textsc{casa}; \citealt{McMullin+07}). To search for emission from the VLA-detected structures (see 
\sect~\ref{sec:vla_cont}), standard wide-field imaging techniques were used to account for non-coplanar 
baselines (w-projection with 64 w-planes{; see} \cite{Cornwelletal2008}). {In addition, no 
time or spectral averaging were applied to the data minimising amplitude losses due to time and bandwidth 
smearing.} However, only emission from the core region was detected above 5$\sigma$. The final, naturally-weighted, images of the core region at both frequencies are displayed in \fig~\ref{fig:MERLINimg}. While 
no self-calibration technique was used on the targets, improved solutions for the
images were obtained via phase-only self-calibration of J1332+4722, and interpolated to NGC~5195 data.

\subsection{Archival VLA - Continuum} 
\label{sec:vla_cont}
We make use of archival multi-configuration VLA observations centred on NGC~5194 in L, C and X-bands, which 
are summarised in \Tab~\ref{tab:vlaObs}. The calibration procedures are explained in detail by 
\cite{Dumasetal2011}. { The  uv datasets 
for each band were combined within \textsc{casa} 
and imaged using multi-scale clean \citep{RC2011}, with scales at 0, 5, 10 and 15 pixels. }For 
accurate morphological and flux density comparisons, the final images (at each frequency) were made 
with minimum and maximum uv-range of 0.5~k$\lambda$ and 180~k$\lambda$ respectively, cellsize of 
0.23\arcs, and robust 1 weighting. Since the datasets were all centred on NGC~5194, to include 
NGC~5195 ($\approx$~5\arcm offset), wide-field images of radius 6\arcm were made {using the 
w-projection \citep{wproj} with 128 planes}.  Primary beam effects were {corrected via} the 
\textsc{casa} task \textsc{impbcor}, and finally a sub-image of NGC~5195 was extracted using 
IMSUBIMAGE. The final images are shown in \fig~\ref{fig:VLAMaps}.



\subsection{Flux density Measurements}

%%% Talk a little about blobcat and filling the blobs down to a minimum S/N threshold.

\textbf{The flux densities were obtained using }\textsc{blobcat} \textbf{\citep{Hales2012_paper,Haless12_soft}, a stand-alone Python program to catalogue objects in a 2D radio-astronomy Stokes-I image. }\textsc{blobcat} \textbf{presents a robust alternative to Gaussian fitting by utilizing the flood fill algorithm \citep{magnenat2012computer} to detect and catalogue complex ``blobs" that represent sources in a 2D astronomical image. To prevent overfitting the ``blobs'', a stopping signal-to-noise ratio of 3 was used\footnote{The parameter fSNR in \textsc{blobcat}.} 
The uncertainties in the final flux density measurements are affected by two main sources: (1) fitting errors from }\textsc{blobcat} \textbf{that takes into account correlated pixel noise, and (2) flux calibration error of $5\%$, which are added in quadrature and adopted as the error measurements, which together with the final flux densities are included in \Tab~\ref{fig:VLAMaps}.  }

\subsection{Multi-Wavelength Data}

Optical images of the M51 system were acquired from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) online archive by \cite{Rampadarathetal15}. For this study we used the images taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS)\footnote{\textit{HST} observing program 10452, P.I. Steven V. W. Beckwith.} \textit{F658N} filter that have been continuum-subtracted showing only H$\alpha$ + [N~II] emission lines.

{Similarly, the M51 system has been observed 12 times  (considering only observations longer than 2 ks) with the \textit{Chandra}/ACIS-S X-ray telescope between 2000 and 2012 (see Table 3 of \citealt{Rampadarathetal15}). The datasets were downloaded from the public Chandra archive. Each observation was reprocessed using tools available in CIAO version 4.5 CITE and CALDB version 4.5.3, to obtain new level-2 event files. The event files were reprojected to a common point and combined, to obtain an image of the M51 system which is described in detail by \cite{Rampadarathetal15}.}

\subsection{Sub-arsecond scale emission}
%Description of what we see in the new e-MERLIN data.

\Fig~ \ref{fig:MERLINimg} shows the e-MERLIN images of NGC~5195 at both L and  and C bands. The 
images reveal a partially resolved compact radio source, with faint emission with an 
elongated morphology  \textbf{(source extent: L-band = 0.34\arcs $\pm$ 0.03 $\approx$ 13.6 $\pm$ 1.2 parsecs; C-band = 0.107\arcs $\pm$ 0.008 $\approx$ 4.3 $\pm$ 0.3 parsecs)\footnote{The source extents are taken as the linear distance from the central peak pixel to the edge of the 3-$\sigma_{rms}$ contour. A single pixel accuracy is assumed for this measurement.}},  possibly outflows from the AGN. The

High resolution radio studies using 
e-MERLIN and VLBI have shown that outflows/jets are common in nearby low-luminosity AGN (e.g. 
\citealt{Krips+2007,GP09}). While the e-MERLIN L and C-band images do suggest a core-
outflow/jet morphology, obtaining a spectral index map would provide more certainty. However, 
large differences in the uv-coverage, combined with the low signal-to-noise ratio of the 
emission (3 - 5~$\sigma_{rms}$), made combining the datasets difficult to determine the 
spectral index distribution with any degree of confidence. 

\textbf{The e-MERLIN C-band dataset was reimaged with a Briggs robust weighting of -1 (the highest 
resolution, 40.8 mas $\times$ 28.5 mas obtainable with the C-band data with a positive 
detection), and resulted in an unresolved compact source with a faint extension. A total flux 
density of 0.28 $\pm$ 0.07 mJy for the unresolved core was measured with the \textsc{aips}} \textbf{task} \textsc{jmfit} \textbf{and an upper limit of the deconvolved size of 0.033\arcs. Using the upper limit for the deconvolved size, gives a brightness temperature of ${\rm log(T_{B} (K))}\geq\,4.1$, an order of magnitude lower than the thermal/non-thermal limit  ${\rm log(T_{B} (K))}\leq\,5.0$ \citep{Condon1992}}


A recent survey of the M51 system with the European VLBI Network (EVN) at 18~cm (resolution 9.9 $\times$ 5.6~mas$^{2}$) did not detect any emission arising from 
the NGC~5195 core above a limit of 132~\mujybm~ \citep{Rampadarathetal15}. This places an upper 
limit on the \textbf{spectral luminosity} of the AGN core of $\approx\,10^{18}\,{\rm W\,Hz^{-1}}$ 
($10^{34}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$) and a limit on brightness temperature ${\rm log(T_{B} (K))}\approx\,7.2$\footnote{Since $T_{\rm B} \propto {\rm flux~density}$ and $\propto {\rm 1/(source~size)}$, thus this value can either be an upper or a lower limit.}.  

\textbf{While this does not rule out a starburst interpretation for the radio emission in the core of NGC~5195, it should be noted that AGNs have been found to be within this brightness temperature range \citep{Garrett2001}. Furthermore, a survey of 7 AGNs (with ${\rm log(T_{B} (K))}\geq\,7$ measured with the EVN) by \cite{Krips+2007}, found brightness temperatures measured by the MERLIN\footnote{The precursor to the eMERLIN array.}  array at C-band to be on the order of ${\rm log(T_{B} (K))}\approx\,4.0$.}

\subsection{Arcsecond scale emission }

The VLA images (Figure \ref{fig:VLAMaps}) reveal a number of interesting features: (1) a bright compact source at the galaxy's centre containing the AGN and e-MERLIN source; (2) an ejecta or jet-like emission, that extends 15\arcs ($\approx$ 0.6 kpc) south of the nucleus (hereafter referred to as ``jet"); (3) an arc of emission 20\arcs - 40\arcs ($\approx$ 0.8 - 1.6 kpc) south of the nucleus, that appears to curve around the jet and nucleus (hereafter referred to as ``radio-arc"). 

%{Interestingly, the jet lacks hot spots that generally demarcates the end of the jet found in more powerful AGNs (e.g. \citealt{PT2000,Girolettietal2003}). This suggests a relatively low velocity jet ($\beta~<~0.76$) that is unable to bore through the local ISM and escape \citep{GGT2004}.}

There is evidence for diffuse, low-surface brightness emission to the North of NGC~5195, that appears 
to extend out of the nucleus. It is difficult to say with confidence whether this is real emission as 
the structure is not consistent across all frequencies. In addition, the distance of NGC~5195 from the pointing centre of the VLA observations (i.e. at the outer edges of the primary beam) increases the image rms noise and hence the uncertainty of the emission being real.

The study by SJMV reported the detection of a pair of X-ray and H$\alpha$ arcs, one at 15\arcs (the ``inner arc") from the nucleus, and  another at $\sim$ 30\arcs (the ``outer arc"). \Figs~\ref{fig:VLAHalpha}a $\&$ b show the \textit{Chandra}/ACIS-S image at 0.3 - 2 keV and \textit{HST}/ACS continuum-
subtracted H$\alpha$ images, with the radio contours from \fig~\ref{fig:VLAMaps}a overlayed.
In both images, the radio jet terminates in regions of bright X-ray and H$\alpha$ emission, with only the 
most southern part of the radio-arc corresponding to X-ray and H$\alpha$ emission. This is most evident in 
the RGB-combined image in \Fig~\ref{fig:VLAHalpha}c. {The images also show the H$\alpha$ emission in the outer arc appears to lie on the outer edge of the X-ray arc. SJMV suggested that this is evidence for displacement of H$\alpha$-emitting material from the core by the X-ray-emitting gas}. 

{However, it is also possible that the mechanism responsible for accelerating the electrons and producing the 
radio emission, is also responsible for the X-ray and the H$\alpha$ emission. This will be explored in \sects~\ref{sec:jet_pwr} and \ref{sec:xrays_orign}.}


\subsection{Spectral index}

To further understand the nature of the emission, the L,  C, and X band images were combined to create a spectral index map. Since the VLA data have already been imaged using the same uvtaper, cellsize and weighting parameters, the C and X band images were re-gridded (via the AIPS task REGRD) to match the L-band image. The three images were 
exported as FITS files and, using astropy, numpy and scipy.optimize.curve$\_$fit, we computed the spectral index map shown in \fig~\ref{fig:Specind}. To remove biasing to steep $\alpha$ 
values due to noise and negative pixels, a 1$\sigma$ flux density cut was imposed on the three images, where $\sigma$ is the rms noise of each uvtapered image\footnote{The choice of a 1$
\sigma$ cut was chosen since the arc is detected at the 3 - 5 $\sigma$ level in the L band image but barely so at the higher frequencies. Thus the spectral index in the arc should be taken as an 
upper limit.} . The final spectral index and noise maps are shown in \fig~\ref{fig:Specind}. 

{The spectral indices obtained for the core and jet ($\alpha \approx$ -0.6 to -0.7 is an indication of a self-absorbed core, as expected by a jet basis where the plasma that is being accelerated \citep{NWF01}. However, spectral index is significantly steeper within the arc ($\alpha <$ -0.7). This steepening of the spectral index in the arc can be the result of synchrotron ageing \citep{CPDL91}, or energy losses due to adiabatic expansion of the material as it does work on its surroundings \citep{CPDL91}. Higher sampling of the radio spectrum at lower radio frequencies is required for full analysis of either effects, and is beyond the scope of this paper.}

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Is the jet responsible for the arcs/bubbles?}
\label{sec:jet_pwr}

{In this study, we show the existence of a sub-kpc radio outflow coincident with X-ray and H$\alpha$ arcs. It is possible that the mechanism responsible for accelerating the electrons to create the radio emission is responsible for both the X-ray and H$\alpha$ emission. If this is true, then one would expect the power output of the nucleus and jet would be sufficient to inflate the X-ray and H$\alpha$ bubble. }To determine this, we estimate the jet power and compare it to the power required to inflate the bubbles.

{The relationship between AGN jet power and observed radio luminosities is an active field of 
research. There have been a number of studies suggesting correlations between the core and lobe 
luminosities with the jet power (see \citealt{MH07,BF2011,GS2016} and references therein). While uncertainties exist with both methods,  the correlation with lobe luminosity maybe weak when the jet energy is dissipated along its path, for example by driving shocks \citep{GS2016}. We therefore estimate the kinematic jet power from the core radio luminosity at 5~GHz, $L_{5 \rm GHz}$, using the 
relation by \cite{MH07}:} 

\begin{equation}
P_{\rm kin} = (0.81\,\pm\,0.11)\,{\rm log}L_{5 \rm GHz}\, +\, 11.9^{+4.1}_{-4.4}.
\end{equation}

From the integrated flux density listed in \tab~\ref{tab:fluxMeas}, using the 5~GHz flux density of the core VLA, we obtain  
$L_{5 \rm GHz} = 1.07 \pm 0.04 \times 10^{36} {\rm erg~s^{-1}}$ and from the relation above, $P_{\rm 
kin} = 1.21^{+0.62}_{-0.66} \times 10^{41} {\rm erg~s^{-1}}$. 

Optical line emission from shocked gas (e.g. H$\beta$), is a reliable measure for mechanical power, 
such as from jets (e.g. \citealt{DopitaSutherland1996,Allenetal2008}). Standard bubble theory \citep{Weaver+1977} predicts for a fully radiative shock expanding into the ISM, {$L_{\rm tot} \approx (27/77)P_{kin}$, where  $L_{\rm tot}$ is the total radiative power and $P_{\rm kin}$, the mechanical power.}
This amount of energy is mostly radiated in the form of IR/optical/UV lines. Radiative shock models ({\it e.g.}, 
{\small {MAPPINGS III}}: \citealt{DopitaSutherland1996}, \citealt{Allenetal2008}) are then used to 
predict the flux distribution between the main lines as a function of shock velocity and ISM density. 
For typical densities ($\sim$0.1--10 cm$^{-3}$), shock velocities between 300 and 600 km s$^{-1}$ \citep{SJMV}, 
solar metallicity and equipartition magnetic field\footnote{{In MAPPINGS III the magnetic field, $B$ and magnetic parameter are chosen to cover extremes expected in the interstellar medium, 
while finely sampling magnetic field strengths near equipartition. Under equipartition conditions the magnetic 
pressure is equal to the thermal pressure, which occurs when $B$ = 3.23 $\mu$G, for a pre-shock 
density of 1~cm$^{-3}$. See \citealt{Allenetal2008} for details.}}, {H$\beta$ emission accounts for a 
fraction (Between $ 5.2\, \pm\, 1.0\, \times\, 10^{-3}$ and $10.3\, \pm\, 2.0\, \times\, 10^{-3}$) of the total radiative power, which gives, }

\begin{equation}
1.8\, \pm\, 0.4\, \times\, 10^{-3}  \lesssim L_{\rm{H}\beta}/P_{\rm kin} \lesssim 3.5\, \pm\, 0.7\, \times\, 10^{-3}  
\label{eq:hbeta_jet}
\end{equation}


\noindent {where $L_{\rm{H}\beta}$ is the H$\beta$ luminosity.} Thus, H$\beta$ luminosity is a powerful diagnostic line for the 
jet power \citep{Pakull+2010}. We do not have a direct measurement of H$\beta$ in NGC 5195; however, 
we can take the measured (and de-reddened) H$\alpha$ flux and assume $F_{{\rm{H}}\alpha} \approx 
2.86F_{{\rm{H}}\beta}$ \citep{OF2006}.

To this end, we measured the background-subtracted count rate in the inner and outer arcs from the 
{\it HST}/ACS image in the F658N filter, which includes H$\alpha$, [N II] $\lambda$ 6548, and [N II] 
$\lambda$ 6583. We multiplied the count rate by the flux-density normalization value PHOTFLAM, and then 
multiplied by the effective width of the filter, to obtain the combined flux in the lines covered by 
the filter. The effective width of F658N is listed as 78 \AA\ in Table 5.1 of the ACS Instrument 
Handbook \footnote{\url{http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/documents/handbooks/current/c05_imaging2.html}}. We 
checked this value using the python task {\small{PYSYNPHOT}}\footnote{\url{https://pysynphot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html}} (as recommended by Jenna Ryon, ACS Instrument Team, priv.~comm.), under the 
plausible assumption that the three lines are much narrower than the filter width. We obtained an 
effective bandpass of 75 \AA\ with {\small{PYSYNPHOT}}, which is the value we adopt here. Thus, the 
total de-reddened flux in the F658N filter is $F_{\rm{F658N}} \approx 3.2 \pm 0.2 \times 10^{-13}$ erg~s$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$.

The next step is to estimate what fraction of the flux in the F658N filter belongs to H$\alpha$ and 
what fraction to the two [N II] lines. This ratio is again a function of ISM density, metallicity, and 
shock velocity \citep{Allenetal2008}. Observations by \cite{Hoopes-Walterbos} suggest a ratio of [N II] 
$\lambda$ 6583/H$\alpha$ $\approx 1.3$ in our region of interest (see their Table 5 and Fig.~19). When 
the expected contribution from [N II] $\lambda$ 6548 is also taken into account (with a theoretically 
predicted value of $F_{6583} \approx 2.95 F_{6548}$, almost independent of ISM conditions: \citep{Allenetal2008}, we obtain that $F_{{\rm{H}}\alpha} \approx
0.37F_{\rm{F658N}}$. Finally, we estimate $F_{{\rm{H}}\beta} \approx 0.35F_{{\rm{H}}\alpha} \approx 
0.13F_{\rm{F658N}}$. We obtain $F_{{\rm{H}}\beta} \approx 4.2 \times 10^{-14}$ erg~s$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$. At the assumed distance of 8~Mpc, this corresponds to a luminosity $L_{\rm{H}\beta} \approx 3.2 \pm 0.12
\times 10^{38}$ erg~s$^{-1}$. 

{Thus, from \eqn~\ref{eq:hbeta_jet}, the mechanical power required to inflate the H$\alpha$ bubble in NGC~5195 ranges from $1.75 \pm 0.40 \times 10^{41}$ erg~s$^{-1} \gtrsim P_{\rm kin} \gtrsim 9.14 \pm 0.34 \times 10^{40}$ erg~s$^{-1}$.
However, this is only the estimate for the southern component of the jet. 
We must assume that there is also a northern component with the same power, even though the ISM density 
there is too low to produce substantial line emission. Thus, the total mechanical power required to inflate the observed H$\alpha$ bubble, inferred from the Balmer lines ranges from  $3.5 \pm 0.80 \times 10^{41}$ erg~s$^{-1} \gtrsim P_{\rm kin} \gtrsim 1.83 \pm 0.68 \times 10^{41}$ erg~s$^{-1}$.}


{The range of the limits reflect the uncertainty in the calculations presented here, that is mainly affected by the uncertainty in the shock velocity and in the ratio between H$\alpha$ and [N~II]. While the line ratios 
presented by \cite{Hoopes-Walterbos} in the region of the H$\alpha$ bubble strongly favours shock ionisation, 
\cite{Alataloetal2016} showed that NGC~5195 is efficiently forming stars, suggesting possible contamination 
from star-formation. Nonetheless, considering the calculation of the jet power using different methods (radio 
power vs. optical line 
emission) agree within a factor of two is encouraging and suggests a similar origin of the H$\alpha$ and 
radio emission within NGC~5195.}

%{Furthermore, the use of radio lobe luminosity to estimate the jet power is in itself uncertain. \cite{GS2016} argued that such studies of the scaling relations between radio luminosities and jet power in 
%powerful radio galaxies (i.e. Fanaroff-Riley types I and II, \citealt{FR74}) are affected by 
%distance.}



%\subsection{The origin of the X-ray emission}
\subsection{The origin of the X-ray emission}
\label{sec:xrays_orign}

SJMV suggest that the curvatures of the X-ray arcs argue for a nuclear origin, at or near the SMBH. In this 
scenario, the arcs are signatures of periodic outbursts arising from infalling matter onto the SMBH 
resulting from a recent merger of the galaxy pair. However, it is possible that the X-ray emission is due 
to other sources within the nuclear region of NGC~5195. 
For example, observations of the interacting starburst system NGC~7714/7715 with \textit{Chandra} by 
\cite{SSN2005} detected an unresolved variable X-ray source within the nucleus. They suggested the X-ray 
emission is possibly from supernovae, O-type stars, Wolf Rayet (W-R) stars,
hot gas, high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), or ULXs. Based upon the lack of evidence for an AGN from 
infrared spectra and an estimated SMBH mass of $< 10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$, they ruled out an AGN as the source 
or the main contributor. \textbf{Thus there is a  possibility 
that some or all of the X-ray emission may have arisen from another source. }



From our spectral modelling of the 
{\it Chandra} X-ray spectrum, the unabsorbed power-law only (ignoring thermal plasma contribution) X-ray luminosity is $L_{\rm X} (2$--$10.0 keV) \approx 0.51 \pm 0.09 \times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at the assumed 
distance. This value includes only the power-law component of the X-ray spectrum (photon index $\Gamma 
\approx 1.56$), which is likely to be directly attributable to the nuclear SMBH. An additional 
(spatially unresolved) thermal-plasma component at a characteristic temperature $kT \approx 0.3$ keV 
contributes a thermal (mekal\footnote{{mekal is a standard emission model available in CIAO and is an emission spectrum from hot diffuse gas from several elements.  Please see \url{http://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa/ahelp/xsmekal.html} for details.}}) luminosity, $L_{\rm{mekal}} \approx 0.35 \pm 0.13 \times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$: this may be evidence 
of \textbf{nuclear star formation}, or of gas shock-ionized by the nuclear jet, {or thermal wind from the accretion disk \citep{Murrayetal1995,Steenbruggeetal2011}}.

%------------------------------------------


According to the fundamental plane of black hole activity (e.g. \citealt{Merloni+2003,Falcke+2004,Kordingetal2006b}) the radio, X-ray luminosities and black hole masses show correlations 
from stellar mass black holes to the SMBH within AGNs. The general picture is one whereby the emission from the jet and/or disc of an active black hole are connected, thereby producing the 
observed correlations, defined as $\log L_{\rm R}\,=\,(4.80\,\pm\,0.24)\,+\,(0.78\,\pm\,0.27)\log M_{\rm BH}\,+\,(0.67\,\pm\,0.12)\log L_{\rm X}$ \citep{Gultekinetal2009}, where the 
X-ray luminosity refers to the \textbf{2--10 keV} band and $L_{\rm R}$ the radio luminosity at 5~GHz.

\textbf{The VLA C-band datasets (listed in \tab~\ref{tab:vlaObs}) were reimaged (in \textsc{casa}), using a robust weighting of -1.5, to match the resolution of the \textbf{Chandra} X-ray 
image ($\approx$ 1\arcs). The resulting image is show in \fig~\ref{fig:radio_xray_pos}, with the position of the 2--10 keV X-ray source in NGC~5195 (denoted by a red ``$+$"), with 
uncertainties are represented by an ellipse. The offset in position between the X-ray and radio sources are $\approx$ 0.4\arcs, which is less than half the resolutions of both images. Furthermore, at $\approx$ 5\arcm from the image centre the \textit{Chandra} psf is known to suffer from degradation \citep{Broosetal2010} that in some cases will produce lower-quality estimates of the source properties.
Thus we are confident that the X-ray and radio emissions are from the same source. From the VLA C-band source, in \fig~\ref{fig:radio_xray_pos} we measure a total flux density of 2.00 $\pm$ 0.34 mJy, resulting in $L_{\rm R} \approx 7.66 \pm 1.78 \times 10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$. }

The mass of the SMBH can be estimated from the $M$-$\sigma$ relation \citep{vandenBosch2016}. Specifically, we used the velocity dispersion $\sigma \approx 127.4\,\pm\,4.9$ km s
$^{-1}$ from the Hyperleda database\footnote{\url{http://leda.univ-lyon1.fr/}} and obtained a best-fitting mass $M \approx 10^{(7.27\pm 0.33)} M_{\odot}$. The expected X-ray luminosity 
from the Fundamental Plane, using these values is $L_{\rm X} \approx 0.85 \pm 0.69 \times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. 

Considering the intrinsic scatter in both the $M$-$\sigma$ relation and the fundamental plane, we conclude that the 
predicted and observed luminosities of the nuclear SMBH are in good agreement at $L_{\rm X} \approx  10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$. 


\subsection{Radiative Efficiency}

Comparing the relative strengths of the X-ray and radio emissions for AGNs, \cite{TW2003, Ho2008} have shown the existence of an inverse correlation between radio-loudness and accretion rate. 


The bolometric luminosity can be estimated as  $L_{\rm {bol}} \sim$ {16} $L_{\rm X}$ 
\citep{Ho2008}, hence $L_{\rm {bol}} \sim 1.6 \times 10^{40}$ 
erg s$^{-1}$. Therefore, the Eddington ratio $L_{\rm{bol}}/L_{\rm{Edd}} \approx$ a few $10^{-6}$, 
falling in the radiatively-inefficient regime.

{The radio loudness of NGC~5195 using the relation defined by \cite{TW2003} as $R_{X} \equiv L_{\nu}(5 ~\rm GHz)/L(2-10~ \rm keV)$. Using  $L(2-10~ \rm keV) = 0.51 \pm 0.09 \times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and $L_{\nu}(5 ~\rm GHz) = 7.66 \pm 1.78 \times 10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$ from \sect~\ref{sec:xrays_orign}, we get log$_{10}(R_{X})$ = -2.8 which places NGC~5195 between radio-quiet and radio-loud AGNs (see \figs~5 and 7 of \citealt{Panessaetal2007}).}


\subsection{Thermal vs non-Thermal Radio Emission}



\section{Conclusion and Summary}

We present a detailed study of the nearby irregular galaxy NGC~5195, making use of new e-MERLIN, 
observations and archive VLA data, X-ray images from \textit{Chandra} and H$\alpha$ images from 
\textit{HST}. 
{Our results support the idea that the mechanism responsible for the radio emission is also driving 
the X-ray and H$\alpha$ arcs. The recovered spectral index favours a non-thermal origin of the 
radio emission from jets/outflows, thus suggesting the X-ray and H$\alpha$ emission are shock-generated. This is consistent with 
the optical line spectra \citep{Hoopes-Walterbos}, which show emission from shock-ionized gas. 
However, this contradicts the assertion from \cite{Alataloetal2016} that all radio emission present 
within the vicinity of NGC~5195's nucleus is most likely associated with star-formation rather than AGN 
activity. The results of \cite{Kohnoetal2002} indicate that NGC~5195 is in a post-starburst stage where 
the remaining diffuse molecular gas is unable to form dense cores via gravitational 
instabilities, due to high stability. Thus, while we cannot rule out contributions from star-formation, we are confident from 
the analyses presented in this study, it is not the dominant contributor to the radio emission at 
centimetre wavelengths.} 

Below, we summarise the main findings of this study:
\begin{enumerate}
\item With the VLA, the radio emission from NGC~5195 on scales of a few hundred parsecs is divided into an unresolved radio core, an ejecta/outflow or jet, and a radio-arc;
\item The e-MERLIN observations reveal a partially resolved source with faint extended emission, possibly outflows from the AGN;
% \item Using previous VLBI observations we place an upper limit on 
% the power output of the AGN core of $\approx\,10^{18}\,{\rm W\,Hz^{-1}}$ ($10^{34}\,{\rm 
% erg\,s^{-1}}$) and the brightness temperature ${\rm T_{B}}\leq\,9\,\times\,10^{5}$~K.
\item The morphology of the VLA jet and radio-arc corresponds to arcs (or bubbles), previously detected in the X-rays with \textit{Chandra} and H$\alpha$ with \textit{HST};
\item {The spectral index distribution of the core and jet are typical for a jet with plasma accelerated at the base of the jet. While the radio-arc possesses a steeper spectrum, possibly from spectral ageing or adiabatic expansion;}
\item Comparing the energetics, we demonstrate that the recent power output of the radio jet is sufficient to generate the H$\alpha$ arcs and filaments, based on standard models of optical line emission from shock-ionized gas. 
%In other words, such features do not require NGC~5195 to have experienced much higher bursts of nuclear activity in the past few Myr;
\item Taking the compact radio core luminosity at 5~GHz, the power-law component of the {\it Chandra} nuclear source as the X-ray core luminosity,{ and an estimate of the black hole mass from the M - $\sigma$ relation,} we show that the SMBH {is within the estimates of} the fundamental plane, with an Eddington ratio $\sim$ a few $10^{-6}$;
\item {The radio-loudness and Eddington ratio places NGC~5195 in the region between radio-quiet and radio-loud AGNs.}

\end{enumerate}

{The radio emission in NGC~5195 shows diverse properties. It's dominated by extended outflows, while possessing a very faint compact core. Further observations of NGC~5195 would be useful in understanding the nature of the radio emission in this galaxy: (i) to reveal the exact nature of the radio emission with deep polarisation studies with the Jansky VLA, (ii) high sensitive multi-wavelength e-MERLIN observations to explore the extended outflows, (iii) being able to detect the VLBI core will be a great opportunity to study the emission process of a nearby faint-AGN on sub-parsec scales, and (iv) multi-low-frequency radio observations are important to study the effects of spectral ageing, which will aid in constraining the age of the emission.}
